# {frontmatter.title}

Welcome! This is [OverflowCat](https://github.com/OverflowCat)'s blog.
Here I write about programming, optics, language learning notes, my weekly life, and more.

The domain
or site name, <span lang="zh"><ruby>新<rt>xīn</rt></ruby><ruby>世<rt>shì</rt></ruby><ruby>界<rt>jiè</rt></ruby><ruby>的<rt>de</rt></ruby><ruby>大<rt>dà</rt></ruby><ruby>門<rt>mén</rt></ruby></span>,
lit. "the gate/door to a new world",
is a Mandarin slang that describes a brand new experience,
such as learning a new language or <span style="background-color: black;">crossdressing</span> for the first time.
By using this term as the site name, I hope I am writing something new
and inspiring.

### Slogans

You may have noticed that there are some slogans go beneath the site name. They are actually quotes from poems that contains the word "world" in them:

- <q>So fancy is the world, who knows, maybe they sing</q>
>
> (Mary Oliver's *This World*)
>
> > As we stay away from each other during these Corona times, nature has a chance to come out of hiding, to stretch its legs and look around at us, the visitors. We too, perhaps, have more moments to stand still and listen to ”the beautiful silence as it comes to all of us, in little earfuls, if we’re not too hurried to hear it”.

- <q>Those that cannot be praised praise the world</q>
>
> (Title of a poem from 木叶)
>
> > Praise presupposes "condescension to the tyranny of the world," and therefore praise itself is a paradox. [...] Just as the Polish poet Zagajewski wrote the song _Trying to Praise the Broken World_ after 9/11, the poet also wrote this song at a time when <q>[compulsory] COVID-19 tests</q> and <q>high rents</q> coexisted. This kind of praise after scrutinizing and tormenting obviously requires a greater skill of courage than those formed without any thought.
