Welcome! This is [OverflowCat](https://github.com/OverflowCat)'s blog.
The domain
or site name, <span lang="zh"><ruby>新<rt>xīn</rt></ruby><ruby>世<rt>shì</rt></ruby><ruby>界<rt>jiè</rt></ruby><ruby>的<rt>de</rt></ruby><ruby>大<rt>dà</rt></ruby><ruby>門<rt>mén</rt></ruby></span>,
lit. "the gate/door to a new world",
is a Mandarin slang that describes a brand new experience,
such as learning a new language or <span style="background-color: black;">crossdressing</span> for the first time.
By using this term as the site name, I hope I am writing something new
and inspiring.
The blog system <Del>will be changed in the near future</Del> <Del>is under construction</Del>
<Add>has been fully migrated to Astro</Add>, and comments will be added later.
