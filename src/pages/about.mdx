# About

Welcome! This is [OverflowCat](https://github.com/OverflowCat)'s blog.
Here I write about programming, optics, language learning notes, my weekly life, and more.

The domain
or site name, <span lang="zh"><ruby>新<rt>xīn</rt></ruby><ruby>世<rt>shì</rt></ruby><ruby>界<rt>jiè</rt></ruby><ruby>的<rt>de</rt></ruby><ruby>大<rt>dà</rt></ruby><ruby>門<rt>mén</rt></ruby></span>,
lit. "the gate/door to a new world",
is a Mandarin slang that describes a brand new experience,
such as learning a new language or <span style="background-color: black;">crossdressing</span> for the first time.
By using this term as the site name, I hope I am writing something new
and inspiring.

### Slogans

You may have noticed that there are some slogans go beneath the site name. They are actually quotes from poems that contains the word "world" in them:

- <q>So fancy is the world, who knows, maybe they sing</q>
>
> (Mary Oliver's *This World*)

- <q>Those that cannot be praised praise the world</q>
>
> (Title of a poem from 木叶)
